# Udacity Project 1: Write a Data Scientist Blog Post

## Udacity Data Scientist  Nanodegree

Every year, Stack Overflow conducted a survey to be able to know better the IT landscape from the perspective of developers, covering all sorts of information like how satisfied do they feel about their job, salary, how many hours do they work and various other information. This year, they amassed more than 64,000 responses fielded from 213 countries. In this project, we used Stack Overflow Survey Data 2017 to attempt to answer some questions like which IDE developers used the most, how their parents' highest education affects their salary, etc. 

## Python libraries requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Summary of the analysis

1. Visual Studio and Notepad++ are two most popular IDE used by developers

2. Nearly the higher parents' highest education, the higher salary of developers.
